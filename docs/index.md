## About

Raylevation is a free, open-source and self hosted alternative to the Google Elevation API and similar offerings.
It was inspired by the [Open-Elevation API](https://github.com/Jorl17/open-elevation).
This service came out of the need to have a hosted, easy to use and easy to setup elevation API. 
While there are some alternatives out there, none of them work out of the box, and seem to point to dead datasets.
Raylevation is easy to setup, has its own docker image and provides a setup functionality for you 
to automatically download the srtm dataset from https://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/srtmdata/.
